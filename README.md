# CV App

This app provides a template for users to create and edit their CV.

This will be my first project using a JavaScript library. With React, I will break the traditional sections of a CV into separate "components," allowing for an interface which is able to re-use code simply by changing their properties and states. Each section will include a button which allows the user to edit and submit new text, thus changing the "state" of said components.
